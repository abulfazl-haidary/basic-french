# Conjugation

*This is how to use a verb in French.*

There are 3 verb groups in French:
- group I (most verbs): verbs infinitif ends in “er”, ex: parler (to speak)
- group II (many verbs): verbs infinitif ends in “ir”, ex: dormir (to sleep)
- group III (few verbs): irregular verbs, ex: aller (to go), être (to be)...

Let’s try with group I verb “manger” (to eat):

## 1) Présent

*Works exactly like present tense in English.*

Manger | To Eat
--- | ---
Je mange | I eat
Tu manges | You eat
Il / Elle / On mange | He / She / One eats
Nous mangeons | We eat
Vous mangez | You (plural or polite) eat
Ils / Elle mangent | They eat

## 2) Participe passé

*There is only one per verb, used to build composed forms like Passé composé (section 4 - Passé).*

Manger | To Eat
--- | ---
mangé | eaten

## 3) Futur

*You can talk about future events by using the construct:*

**Pronoun + [aller, present tense, conjugated] + verb infinitive**

*It is actually close to the English construct “going to” as in “I’m going to eat soon!”*

Manger | To Eat
--- | ---
Je vais manger | I am going to eat
Tu vas manger | You are going to eat
Il / Elle / On va manger | He / She / One is going to eat
Nous allons manger | We are going to eat
Vous allez manger | You (plural or polite) are going to eat
Ils / Elles vont manger | They are going to eat

## 4) Passé
*To talk about a past event you can use the construct:*

**Pronoun + [être or avoir, present tense, conjugated] + participe passé**

*It is like in English when you say: I have seen it!*

*note: you need to memorize for each verb if you should use être or avoir, and how it could affect the meaning of the sentence: I have eaten yesterday / I was eaten yesterday.*

Manger | To Eat
--- | ---
J’ai mangé | I have eaten
Tu as mangé | You have eaten
Il / Elle / On a mangé | He / She / One has eaten
Nous avons mangé | We have eaten
Vous avez mangé | You (plural or polite) have eaten
Ils / Elles ont mangé | They have eaten


## Bonus:

## 5) En train de se produire
*You can talk about some event happening right now by using this construct:*

**Pronoun + [être, present, conjugated] en train de + verb infinitive**

*In English you’d use “verb-ing”: I’m thinking about something...*

Manger | To Eat
--- | ---
Je suis en train de manger | I am eating
Tu  es en train de manger | You are eating
Il / Elle / On  est en train de manger | He / She / One is eating
Nous  sommes en train de manger | We are eating
Vous  êtes en train de manger | You (plural or polite) eating
Ils / Elles  sont en train de manger | They are eating

## You should learn the present tense of the verbs: être (to be), avoir (to have) and aller (to go):

Etre | To Be
--- | ---
Je suis | I am
Tu  es | You are
Il / Elle / On  est | He / She / One is
Nous  sommes | We are
Vous  êtes | You (plural or polite) are
Ils / Elles  sont | They are

Avoir | To Have
--- | ---
J’ai | I have
Tu as | You have
Il / Elle / On a | He / She / One has
Nous avons | We have
Vous avez | You (plural or polite) have 
Ils / Elles ont | They have

Aller | To Go
--- | ---
Je vais | I go
Tu vas | You go
Il / Elle / On va | He / She / One goes
Nous allons | We go
Vous allez | You (plural or polite) go
